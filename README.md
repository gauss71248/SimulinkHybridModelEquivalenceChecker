# SimulinkHybridModelEquivalenceChecker
This repository contains the source code of my PhD thesis. The parser code is written in Java, partially in Scala. 
The core, which forms the equivalence checker, is written in Scala.

All modules are Eclipse extensions. A requirement is the Eclipse modelling distribution.
Beware, the coding is prototypic in nature and not very well documented. This is quite common in research projects.

## Core Engine for Simulink Model Equivalence Checking

The core is at the path de.tu_berlin.sese.cormorant.frameworkInstantiation/src/de/tu_berlin/sese/cormorant/frameworkInstantiation/EquivalenceVerifier
